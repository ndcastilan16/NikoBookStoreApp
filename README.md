# NikoBookStoreApp


My code was created using .net Core with the following patterns/pattern:

1. Created different components for each section of the book app store
2. Used React to develop the Book Application
3. Wasn't able to fully used some React Libraries like the Modal and Cards libraries(was losing time so I have to do it manually"
4. Tried  to make my code to comply with the SOLID guidelines
5. Originally planned to make a class for the different shipping options.
6. Wasn't able to make other functionalities reusable.


Functionalities:

1. User can search for a book by author or title
2. Pop up box will apear when the "buy" button is clicked
3. Delivery Details will be generated depending on the shipping option
4. User is able to confirm delivery details and buy the book
5. User can view details
